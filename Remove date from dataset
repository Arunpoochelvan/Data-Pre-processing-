It looks like your input (date) is a series of string representations of date and time, with a space between the date and the time. If the format is guaranteed to be consistent with what you showed here, then you could use a list comprehension:

date = [x.split()[0] for x in date]
dt = np.array(date)
Alternatively, if date were a series of datetime objects, you could use:

date = [x.date().isoformat() for x in date]
dt = np.array(date)
Edit: If I'm understanding correctly that this is a Pandas dataframe with a single column, containing string representations of dates and times, the following would be one way to retain the dtype=object property:

def trim_to_date(s): 
     return s.split()[0]
date = date[0].apply(trim_to_date) 
dt = np.array(date))

map(lambda x: x[:10], dates)


from dateutil import *

arr = np.array(['2017-02-14 09:00:00', '2017-02-15 09:00:00', '2017-02-16 09:00:00'])

np.array([parser.parse(i).strftime('%Y-%m-%d') for i in arr])

# array(['2017-02-14', '2017-02-15', '2017-02-16'],
#       dtype='<U10')
